This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

# My Next.js Blog App

This is a simple blog application built with **Next.js** that displays blog posts dynamically, and is SEO-friendly with static generation. It's easy to deploy and customize.

## Features
- Display blog posts dynamically
- Customizable blog layout
- Easy to deploy to platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages

## Requirements
- Node.js (v12 or later)
- npm or yarn (for managing dependencies)

## Running the Project Locally

### 1. Clone the repository:
Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate into the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name

npm install
or
yarn install

npm run dev
or
yarn dev


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
